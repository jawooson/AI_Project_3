# NYU // AI // Project 03 // CodeSearchNet

This is an extension of the [CodeSearchNet](https://app.wandb.ai/github/codesearchnet/benchmark) competition. 

## A brief overview of the project
[CodeSearchNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09436)  is a collection of datasets and benchmarks that explore the problem of code retrieval using natural language. This research is a continuation of some ideas presented in this  [blog post](https://githubengineering.com/towards-natural-language-semantic-code-search/)  and is a joint collaboration between GitHub and the  [Deep Program Understanding](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/program/)  group at  [Microsoft Research - Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). We aim to provide a platform for community research on semantic code search via the following:

1.  Instructions for obtaining large corpora of relevant data
2.  Open source code for a range of baseline models, along with pre-trained weights
3.  Baseline evaluation metrics and utilities
4.  Mechanisms to track progress on a  [shared community benchmark](https://app.wandb.ai/github/CodeSearchNet/benchmark)  hosted by  [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/)

We hope that CodeSearchNet is a step towards engaging with the broader machine learning and NLP community regarding the relationship between source code and natural language. We describe a specific task here, but we expect and welcome other uses of our dataset.

More context regarding the motivation for this problem is in this  [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09436).
